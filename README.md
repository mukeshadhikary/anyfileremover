# File Remover

This Python script allows you to recursively search and remove files with a specific extension from a specified directory.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

4. Run the script with the following command:


Replace `/path/to/your/directory` with the actual directory path from which you want to remove files, and replace `.extension` with the specific file extension you want to remove (e.g., `.srt`).

5. The script will recursively search for and remove all files with the specified extension in the specified directory and its subdirectories.

6. After the script completes, it will display a message indicating that all files with the specified extension have been removed successfully.

**Note:** Be cautious when using this script, especially with elevated privileges, as it can permanently delete files. Double-check the directory path and file extension you provide to avoid unintended data loss.
